UWP-011 - Laudable Layout Challenge

1. Use only a Grid control.
2. I used the designer of a 5" Phone 1920x1080 300% scale.
3. The large textblock's size is 48 points.
4. Most of the margins are either 10 or 20 pixels.
5. The TextBlocks for First Name, Last Name and Email should be centered vertically in the row.

6. Tricky: You'll need to figure out how to allow your TextBlock title to span multiple columns.
(Hint: Use Intellisense!)

Remember: Try to solve this without my help!
Also: Only watch enough of the solution video to get unstuck.

If you do solve it without my help, you should watch the entire solution video to see a different approach.

UWP-013 - Legendary Layout Challenge

Use only StackPanel controls.
I use the designer of a 13.3 Desktop (1280 x 720) 100% Scale.
The large textblock's size is 48 points.  
The left-most textblock is 250 pixels wide.
The second textblock is 500 pixels wide.
Get the text from the LoremIpsum.txt file.
The third area is 300 pixels wide.
Most of the margins are either 10 or 20 pixels.
You'll need to use the TextWrapping property of the TextBlocks.

Remember: Try to solve this without my help!
Also: Only watch enough of the solution video to get unstuck.

If you do solve it without my help, you should watch the entire solution video to see a different approach.
